            <h1>Research + Planning</h1>
            <p>In my study the existing website, I found that a majority of the sought-after content was sprinkled throughout the site, making it difficult to find. To improve this experience, we needed to:</p>
            <ul class="content-list">
              <li>gather all admissions related content and put it in one easily accessible place</li>
              <li>provide answers to as many frequently asked questions as possible</li>
              <li>organize new and old content in an intuitive and meaningful manner</li>
              <li>market to potential students (and their parents) and convince interested students to apply</li>

          <div class="competition">
            <h2>Analyzing the Competition</h2>
            <p>Similar institutions in Qatar organized admissions content differently, but offered more or less the same amount of information. By studying the websites of larger institutions that, by nature, contained more content, we identified creative new ways to group content.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="survey">
            <h2>User Focus Group</h2>
            <p>To better understand our target audience, we conducted a focus group. We gathered 30 current students and asked them questions about their experiences during the admissions process.</p>
            <div class="survey-results">
              <p><b>66%</b><br class="br"> of students said he/she was confused or uncertain about when the application was due.</p>
              <p><b>84%</b><br class="br"> of respondents said that he/she deliberated the academic and non-academic aspects equally when deciding where to apply.</p>
              <p><b>72%</b><br class="br"> of respondents said he/she found descriptions and images of daily life in Qatar helpful.</p>

             <h2>User Tasks + Flows</h2>
             <p>As a page within a larger website, we needed to create a way for visitors to find content without excessive scrolling or searching the full website. Beginning with our newly identified content groups, we created a secondary navigation system and used it to develop user tasks and flows, helping visitors:</p>
             <ul class="content-list">
               <li>skip directly to the content he/she is looking for</li>
               <li>discover essential university information by scrolling through strategically grouped content</li>
               <li>learn more about a particular subject via links to other pages within the larger website</li>
               <li>feel more comfortable and have a better understanding of the university</li>

            <p>Beginning with quick hand-drawn sketches, I developed high-fidelity wireframes that helped give the admissions team a visual representation of the work we'd done so far. Discussions about the order of sections, imagery, and functionality guided the iteration process.</p>

            <p>As a product of the university, the look and feel of the website needed match the existing brand, so all of my design decisions had to be made within the boundaries of the visual identity system.</p>

        <section class="conclusion">
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>The purpose for this redesign was to provide the maximum amount of accessible information to the target audience and, though the credit can’t all be attributed to the new website, the university had its highest application and admission rate of any year since the school opened in Qatar. While I’m happy with the final product, I’d like the opportunity to conduct a user test with current and potential students.</p>
